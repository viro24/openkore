#Extreme V1.0 :lol:
#
#Purpose:
#Create a Novice and then simply watch it become Level 99 [Insert a job here] without moving a finger!! [In my Example it's High Wizard]
#I must say that it is extremely useful for making bot armies. Before I had to level each of my bots manually which was a pain in a$$ since my bots were banned frequently.
#
#Use:
#Do not just copy paste it!!! This Macro is written for a High Rate server with a Job Changer, NPC Warp and @go command.
#Use this as a reference and make your own macro that fits your needs!
#
#Minimum Modification:
#1) NPC Locations and Talk Sequences
#2) Job you want
#3) Maps where you want to level
#4) Skills and stats you want to up
#5) Weapon configuration (Melee/Range/Spells)
#6) Levels at which you want the Macro to Trigger
#7) Jobs at which you want Macro to Trigger
#8) Your save location
#9) Desired levels
#
